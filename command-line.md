> Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

Command line is a way to talk to your computer. You write in commands, and it follows.

Commands can vary from just showing you information that you ask, to making changes to files and folders that exist on your computer.

There are standard commands that all computers know, and they only know those standard commands. If a dog learns "Sit", it will follow the command. But it doesn't know the command "Have a seat", so it won't follow your command. Speak the language the dog/computer knows, and it will follow the command you give it.

> List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

rm - remove/delete a file or folder. Must be next to that file or folder to delete it.
new-item - make a new file
cp - copy a file or folder. The format of this command is: cp copythis.txt here.txt OR cp copythis.txt putithere/
exit - close the terminal/window where you are writing your command line
pwd - print working directory = where am I right now?
cd - change directories = go to this new place
ls - list everything inside this directory
mkdir - make a new directory
rmdir - remove a directory. Must be exactly above the folder you're deleting
pushd = leave this directory to go to another directory, but remember this one so I can go back to it
popd = now, take me back to that previous/pushd directory
mv - move a file/folder. You can also use this to rename an item bc it acts like it's cutting the file out and then repasting it, but this time with the new name
more = see what's inside a file
